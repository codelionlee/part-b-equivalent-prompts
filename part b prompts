what is big data 
ChatGPT
Big data refers to large and complex sets of data that exceed the processing capabilities of traditional data management tools and techniques. It involves the collection, storage, analysis, and visualization of vast amounts of structured and unstructured data from various sources. The term "big data" encompasses three main aspects:

Volume: Big data involves massive amounts of data that cannot be managed or analyzed using traditional methods. It includes terabytes, petabytes, or even exabytes of information generated from diverse sources such as sensors, social media, transaction records, and more.

Velocity: Big data is often generated and collected at high speeds. Real-time or near-real-time data streams require rapid processing and analysis to extract valuable insights. Examples include data generated from financial transactions, social media updates, website clickstreams, or sensor readings.

Variety: Big data comes in various formats and structures, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. Structured data refers to well-organized data with a fixed schema, such as data stored in relational databases. Semi-structured data, like XML or JSON files, has some structure but doesn't conform to a rigid schema. Unstructured data, such as text documents, images, videos, or social media posts, lacks a predefined structure.

Additionally, big data projects often incorporate the concept of the "fourth V":

Veracity: Big data is characterized by uncertainty and inconsistency. It may contain errors, noise, or incomplete information, which can affect the accuracy and reliability of analysis. Veracity refers to the quality and trustworthiness of the data, including measures to ensure data integrity and address potential biases.
To harness the potential of big data, organizations use advanced technologies, such as distributed storage systems (like Hadoop and NoSQL databases) and parallel processing frameworks (like Apache Spark), to store, process, and analyze the data. Big data analytics techniques, including machine learning, data mining, and predictive analytics, help extract valuable insights, make informed decisions, and gain a competitive edge in various fields like business, healthcare, finance, marketing, and more.

Feudalism and techno feudalism analysis and critique
Techno-feudalism links technology and the feudal form of governance. Technology advancements have put artificial intelligence and neural networks as well as various forms of data collection, analysis and predictions as the foundation of societal growth and advancement. In Europe feudalism took place in the 1000 and 1300 year period. The idea of land being owned by kings and a descending heierichal structure of lords and lessers controlling the use, protection and distribution of land forms a foundation of a feudal state. In this type of governance ordinary individuals are expected to produce and or pay back the royal family for providing them with land, order and protection. This brings about grounds to define Techno Feudalism as the system where tech companies are seen as the state’s governing body and the government as rather a puppet and an execution body that can use lawas and position to enforce any agenda they set and agree on. It is clear that governments are prone to favor giant tech companies as well giant tech companies have the ability to negotiate and alter means of entry into a specific industry, limiting competitions as well centralising tech power just as the king, lord, lesser and ‘povo’geberal populus. Similar to Feudalism, tech feudalism recognises the elite class and the the general population ‘povo’ serve the elite. Feudalism base its existence on land as a valuable resource whereas Techno-Feudalism boasts on technological advancement and related impelemantations (Walters,  2020).  

“...history is simultaneously moving forwards technologically and backwards politically” (Walters,  2020). Big tech companies can easily be viewed as bringing about tech feudalism as they now have access to more data that can be used to investigate, analyse and even manipulate individuals into specifics that feed their desires and fills their banks. This brings about a centralisation of certain powers to specific big giant companies. The core objective of big tech companies is not to assist the government but to gain and maximize profits but doing that means they have to create a functioning relationship with governing structures or vica versa. A good example is the FBI Apple case where FBI relied on a giant tech company (Apple) to provide private information through hacking a device of a specific citizen without consent  but was unsuccessful. It is only a concern having governments unashamed to seek assistance and be seen relying on giant tech companies to invade privacy inorder to achieve their goals. This highlights a general problem in relations created between giant tech companies and governance (Kharpal, 2016). 
Feudality of  political institutions .
Political institutions are a resemblance of a distribution of power just as the feudal system but there are differences. Political systems cannot be feudal as the division of power in feudalism and techno feudalism is different. The current form of ruling promotes centralisation of power and be it which company is a question thats answered by the size and effect of the tech giant in techno feudalism. 
Are Economic systems feudal .

Economic systems aim to…  The economic system can be a feudal with no regret for it incorporates the general public working to repay the big tech companies for their technology just as the feudal system paid back surplus to kings as an appreciation for the land. 
Feudality of Social Relations
 Fedalism used birth and predecessors where as Tehcno feudalism base on who first entered the industry and how big they have managed to be (Kenny, 1994). Techno feudalism in social relations is similar to relations that were groomed from feudalism that brought about hierarchy systems. The current tech feudalism look into making a hierarchy system hence a stand for it to align with feudalism.  Social relations directly affect social interaction and defines the hierarchy.
Surveillence Capitalism in a tech feudlism era. 
Surveilence Capitalism is ‘Big data’,which is a large and complex data set that is used to process and predict as well manage certain aspects of life. It is not limited to strage but extends to visualisation, analysis and collection of information in aim to profit or maximise profit margins.   (Zubof, 2015). This is a tool that techno fedalists use to gain knowldge and make decisions as well plan their future in business. Surveillance capitalism centralises power unlike in the fedaral society where power was split and divided.  

CONCLUSION
It is clear that advocating for techno feudalism being for the modern era brings about different positions in arguments. Feudalism is simplest to understand and its hierarchical structure is clear from King to general public as well responsibilities of individuals and groups are outlined. Techno feudalism on the other hand has no defined and clear hierarchy and brings a confusing view of the governments position in shaping a better world.  Techno feudalism is complex to understand and hence the whole idea needs to be dismised in my view as it lacks a reasonable foundation of power and a bundery between tech and governments.

Definition and Motivation of the Current Era

The present era is commonly referred to as the cyber, information, and digital era. In this era, decision-making processes rely heavily on the collection, storage, and retrieval of data. This practice extends beyond business decision-making and encompasses emerging tech-oriented governmental strategies as well. Nowadays, we spend a significant amount of time on the internet, utilizing digital technologies and devices to improve the world and enhance the overall human experience.

Analysis and Critique of Feudalism and Techno-Feudalism

Techno-feudalism is a concept that links technology with the feudal form of governance. Technological advancements have positioned artificial intelligence, neural networks, data collection, analysis, and predictions as the foundations of societal growth and advancement. Feudalism, which occurred in Europe between the 10th and 13th centuries, revolved around the ownership of land by kings and a hierarchical structure of lords and subjects who controlled the use, protection, and distribution of land. In this governance system, ordinary individuals were expected to produce and/or pay tribute to the royal family in exchange for land, order, and protection. Techno-feudalism can be defined as a system in which tech companies assume the role of the state's governing body, while the government acts as a puppet and execution body that enforces the agendas set by these companies. Governments often show favoritism towards giant tech companies, and these companies, in turn, have the power to negotiate and control entry into specific industries, thereby limiting competition and consolidating tech power, similar to the hierarchical structure of feudalism. Just as in feudalism, techno-feudalism recognizes an elite class while the general population (referred to as 'povo') serves the elite. Feudalism was based on land as a valuable resource, whereas techno-feudalism emphasizes technological advancement and its associated implementations (Walters, 2020).

"History is simultaneously moving forwards technologically and backwards politically" (Walters, 2020). Big tech companies can be seen as catalysts for the rise of techno-feudalism, as they have access to vast amounts of data that can be used to investigate, analyze, and even manipulate individuals based on their desires and profit motives. This concentration of power in specific giant companies mirrors the objectives of big tech companies, which are primarily focused on maximizing profits. However, achieving this objective necessitates establishing functional relationships with governing structures, or vice versa. A notable example is the FBI Apple case, where the FBI sought assistance from a giant tech company (Apple) to extract private information from a specific citizen's device without their consent, although this attempt was unsuccessful. It is concerning to witness governments unabashedly seeking assistance from and relying on giant tech companies to invade privacy in order to achieve their goals. This highlights a general issue in the relationship between giant tech companies and governance (Kharpal, 2016).

Feudality of Political Institutions

Political institutions resemble the distribution of power in feudal systems, but there are differences. Political systems cannot be considered feudal, as the division of power in feudalism and techno-feudalism differs. The current form of governance promotes the centralization of power, and the size and influence of tech giants determine which company takes on the role of a feudal power in techno-feudalism.

Are Economic Systems Feudal?

Economic systems aim to... Economic systems can exhibit feudal characteristics without remorse, as they often involve the general public working to repay big tech companies for their technology, similar to how the feudal system required surplus production as an appreciation for the land.

Apologies for the incomplete response. Here is the remainder of the edited essay:

on who entered the industry first and how big they have become (Kenny, 1994). Techno-feudalism in social relations mirrors the hierarchical systems that evolved from feudalism. The current tech feudalism strives to establish a hierarchy system, aligning with feudalism. Social relations directly impact social interactions and define the hierarchy.

Surveillance Capitalism in a Techno-Feudalism Era

Surveillance capitalism refers to the utilization of "big data," which entails large and complex datasets used for processing, prediction, and managing various aspects of life. It encompasses not only data storage but also visualization, analysis, and information collection, all aimed at generating profits or maximizing profit margins (Zuboff, 2015). Techno-feudalists employ surveillance capitalism as a tool to gain knowledge, make decisions, and plan their business future. Unlike the feudal society, surveillance capitalism centralizes power rather than dividing it.

Conclusion

Advocating for techno-feudalism in the modern era elicits different viewpoints. Feudalism is easily understood, with a clear hierarchical structure that extends from the king to the general public, outlining the responsibilities of individuals and groups. On the other hand, techno-feudalism lacks a defined and clear hierarchy, resulting in confusion about the government's role in shaping a better world. Techno-feudalism is complex to comprehend, and in my view, the entire concept should be dismissed as it lacks a reasonable foundation of power and a boundary between tech companies and governments.
